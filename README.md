This repository provides a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that connects LLMs and applications
to Decodo's platform. The server facilitates integration between MCP-compatible clients and Decodo's
services, streamlining access to our tools and capabilities.

## Features

- Easy web data access. Simplified retrieval of information from websites and online sources.
- Geographic flexibility. Access content regardless of regional restrictions.
- Enhanced privacy. Browse and collect data while maintaining anonymity.
- Reliable scraping. Advanced techniques to avoid detection and blocks.
- Simple integration. Seamless setup with popular MCP clients like Claude Desktop, Cursor, and
  Windsurf.

## Running with an MCP client

1. Start a [Decodo integrations plan](https://decodo.com/scraping/web) with 2.5k free requests.

2. Copy the auto-generated basic authentication token in the Web Advanced page.

    }
  }
}
```

## Parameters

The following parameters are inferred from user prompts:

| Parameter      | Description                                                                                          |

| `jsRender`     | Renders target URL in a headless browser.                                                            |
| `geo`          | Sets the country from which the request will originate.                                              |
| `locale`       | Sets the locale of the request.                                                                      |

| `fullResponse` | Skips automatic truncation and returns full content. If context window is small, may throw warnings. |

## Examples

### Scraping geo-restricted content

Query your AI agent with the following prompt:

```
Scrape peacock.com from a German IP address and tell me the pricing.
```

This prompt will say that peacock.com is geo-restricted. To bypass the geo-restriction:

```
Scrape peacock.com from a US IP address and tell me the pricing.
```

### Limiting number of response tokens

If your agent has a small context window, the content returned from scraping will be automatically
truncated, in order to avoid context-overflow. You can increase the number of tokens returned within
your prompt:

```
Scrape hacker news, return 50k tokens.
```

If your agent has a big context window, tell it to return `full content`:

```
Scrape hacker news, return full content.
```
